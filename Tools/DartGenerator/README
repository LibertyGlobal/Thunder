# rdkservices dart generator

This tool generates the rdkservices API library in dart language.

# usage
`jsonrpc_to_dart.py`  is a generator which transforms the file with jsonrpc2
defintion into the dart file.

The `gen.sh script` runs the generator for each json file from `API_FILES`
list and generates the package in the directory pointed by `outdir` variable.

Currently both variables are hardcoded in gen.sh script.

# tests
The `gen.sh script` generates tests based on mocks.
The mocks are using real jsons from communication with CPE.
You can grab the jsons using command:
CPE_HOST=[Your CPE IP] dart test --chain-stack-traces ./test/tool/*
To run the test please execute:
dart test --chain-stack-traces ./test/[Test name]
