# rdkservices dart generator

This tool generates the rdkservices API library in dart language.

# usage
`jsonrpc_to_dart.py`  is a generator which transforms the file with jsonrpc2
defintion into the dart file.

The `gen.sh script` runs the generator for each json file from `API_FILES`
list and generates the package in the directory pointed by `outdir` variable.

Currently both variables are hardcoded in gen.sh script.
